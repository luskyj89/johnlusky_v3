				<p>Born in the strange, humble town of Birdsboro, Pennsylvania, I began experimenting with web design and web development 
				when I was 13 years old. I began attending Philadelphia University in 2008, and I graduated with a B.S. in Interactive 
				Design and Media in 2012. I started working at 1 Trick Pony- an ad agency based out of Hammonton, New Jersey- a few days 
				after graduation.</p>

				<p>My current job is a full-time development gig (probably 90% front-end) and Iâ€™ve worked with several great clients such 
				as American Express, Virgin Mobile, Sony Pictures Classics, Turner Classic Movies, and Hard Rock Hotels over the past two 
				years. However, I do both development and design work for freelance clients on the side.</p>

				<p>As far as other hobbies go, I dabble in photography and video, and I write for a gaming blog called Multitoad that I 
				started with a friend. I also enjoy beer, filet mignon, and mozzarella sticks- probably in that order.</p>
